My research focuses on human communication, and in particular on the ways in which speech is produced and understood.  Among other techniques, I use ultrasound imaging of the midsagittal tongue contour to investigate the production of speech errors that might not otherwise be detected, and eyetracking and EEG to measure the ways in which listeners respond to disfluent speech.
